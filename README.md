README
=====================================

This is a super-simple OpenAL example/demo program, compiled from various sources, built for GNU/Linux, mostly for the purposes of myself learning OpenAL. I made this because there seem to be very few actual OpenAL tutorials that don't use ALUT (which is deprecated) and make logical sense. By this I mean Google failed me and I got bored of looking. This is mostly for my own personal reference, but if your own Googling led you here, kudos!
